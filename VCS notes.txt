1.Multiple Resources are working with a single document/project
2. To keep track of the changes made by each resource.

Types of VCS:

2. Centralized
3. Distributed

Local -> MS word, Excel, Powerpoint
Centralized -> Team Foundation Server from Microsoft, SVN --> Subversion

Distributed -> Multiple local repositories are maintained 
Git --> local rep  -> download and install in the local system
Github --> Remote rep --> create an account for us in github.com
